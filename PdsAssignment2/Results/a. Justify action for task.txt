To handle missing data in the 'Mileage,' 'Engine,' and 'Power' columns, the median is chosen as the replacement method. The median is a suitable choice as it maintains the central tendency of the data and is robust against outliers. For the 'Seats' column, the mode is employed to replace missing values, as it represents a discrete, quantitative attribute. In the case of the 'New_Price' column, it is more prudent to remove the entire column due to the substantial number of missing values, as attempting to fill them could introduce outliers and compromise the integrity of the analysis.
